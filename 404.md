# Page not found (404)

I'm sorry, but the page you were looking for did not exist.  Sometimes I make a link to a page with the intention of adding that page later on, and perhaps you stumbled upon one of those.  In any case, we're sorry.  If you have a question, feel free to ask in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/statecharts/statecharts/discussions) or [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/statecharts/statecharts).

If you're just browsing check out these great pages instead:

- [What is a statechart?](/what-is-a-statechart.html)
- [How do I use a statechart?](/how-to-use-statecharts.html)

Please take your time to look through the glossary if there's any concept you're unclear about:
